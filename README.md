# README: Comparing Computational Models in the Morris Water Maze (MWM)

## Project Goals

**Objective 1:** Determine **if and when** the distance-cell model can outperform the place-cell model under **fixed-platform** conditions.

**Objective 2:** Evaluate the performance of the **combined place-distance cell model** across various balance ratios, compared to the place-only and distance-only models.

## Important Notes Before Running

- For multiple repetitions and reliable statistical comparisons, set:

```r
pln <- 0
Nruns <- 10
For single-run trajectory visualizations, set:
